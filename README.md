# calculator
This project is a fully functional iPhone calculator clone built using Flutter. The app replicates the interface and functionality of the iPhone's native calculator, offering a user-friendly UI and core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), along with percentage and clear functions.

# Features:
iPhone-style calculator design
Support for basic arithmetic operations
Percentage and clear functions
Responsive layout for different screen sizes

# Logic:
The logic behind the calculator's arithmetic operations is powered by the math_expressions package (version ^2.6.0). This package simplifies expression parsing and evaluation, allowing for efficient calculation handling in the app.

# Tech Stack:
Flutter: For building the cross-platform app
Dart: For writing the logic
math_expressions: For parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions
